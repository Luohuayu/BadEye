In order to serve its purpose of preventing and detecting the use of cheat software with the goal of ensuring a fair game environment, BattlEye may process the following information from you:

- IP address
- Game identifiers (e.g. in-game name, account ID, etc.)
- Hardware device information and identifiers (e.g. serial numbers)
- Information about the running operating system
- Information about game-related and operating-system-related files and memory
- Information about running processes, drivers and other executable code
- File names included in other information listed here, which might also contain your operating system user name

BattlEye follows a data minimization policy that ensures that data is only being stored when necessary, i.e. when BattlEye finds information that may potentially indicate the use of cheat software. As a result, BattlEye generally will not store any information on most users.

BattlEye may store the information for the entire duration of the provision of its services for the game.

You may contact Ubisoft at any time to exercise your rights in relation to this data processing. See BattlEye's Privacy Policy, https://www.battleye.com/privacy-policy/, and Ubisoft's Privacy Policy, https://legal.ubi.com/privacypolicy, for more information.
