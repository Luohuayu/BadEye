# Info

just double click `BELauncher.exe`, it should open and protect the cmd sitting in the same folder... If you get any errors simply replace the file with your cmd.exe and it should work fine.
Nevertheless if BattlEye ever patches this the lsass.exe/csrss.exe hooks will be installed even if BattlEye refuses to protect such applications.
